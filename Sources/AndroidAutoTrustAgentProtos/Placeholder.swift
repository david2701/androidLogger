/// Placeholder for TrustAgent Protos.

/// This file needs to be here to trigger the build for the `AndroidAutoTrustAgentProtos` module
/// from the corresponding Swift Package Manager target. A plugin will generate the source files for
/// each proto file in this directory, but there has to be at least one Swift file (this
/// placeholder) in this directory to trigger the build rules.
